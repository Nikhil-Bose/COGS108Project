With the high cost of living, we also wanted to see what other factors have also impacted homelessness.

As a result, we do not anticipate spending too much effort on actually cleaning and standardizing our data. We will, however, need to inspect the contents of our datasets to strip away the particular dimensions that are either too specific for the scope of our study or contain too few points for meaningful analysis. Similarly, we also expect to spend much of our time dealing with the challenges of merging together and associating the features of our different types of data. Finally, we will need to apply correctional methods specific to our data sources (e.g. adjusting Zillow pricing data to adjust for inflation and accounting for the overall rates of increase in population numbers)\n",

By associating together multiple differing time series (i.e. rate of homelessness in Los Angeles against drug use or crime rates), we will attempt to identify various factors which might be used as an indicator or predictor of increased rates of homelessness. We anticipate our initial efforts in the study will focus on the analysis of Los Angeles on the county level. However, depending on our evaluation of the reliability and accuracy of our datasets, we may expand upon our analysis to add a dimension of geography to our study by analyzing trends and characteristics of different regions within the Los Angeles county on the city level.\n",

One aspect of our data that may cause concern is how we do have crime and drug charge data, but all users are anonymized in the datasets so all we have access to is the geographical location and time points, but not the identities of the people that have committed the crimes themselves. Some other potential biases that we may need to watch out for, are that the datasets represent a wide range of datasets (from sizes of 26 to 48584), and they’re from geographically different communities at different time periods. We will also need to proceed with the understanding that these datasets are not holistic, as the data only covers what was obtained (there may be “data points” that were not collected).  As described earlier in the Proposed Methods section, we will do our best to account for these biases by applying correctional methods in a cross-correlational way. "

Most people affected by homelessness do not have access to a computer, and are not able to participate in online surveys that are a big source of data for information such as drug usage.\n"
